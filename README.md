Python code for chemical engineering : master classes and research

This page contains some code that are used in chemical engineering classes at University of Toulouse (France). The M1* file correspond to exercises that are treated in the first year of the Master in chemical engineering of Toulouse (Université Toulouse III).

-M1_electrochimie code allows to calculate the oxydation rate of glucose at an electrode. It allows to treat the coupling between an heterogeneous reaction and the diffusion in a mass boundary layer and to use the Damkholer number.

-M1_cristal code allows to calculate the growing rate of a cristal. It allows to treat the coupling between an heterogeneous reaction and the diffusion in a mass boundary layer and to use the Damkholer number for a second order reaction.

-M1_catalyseur code allows to calculate the consomption of a reactant by a porous catalytic bead. It allow to treat the coupling between an heterogeneous reaction and the internal diffusion in the porous media and to use the Thiele modulus.

-M1_ultrafiltration code allows to calculate the filtration rate for a given transmembrane pressure when the process is limited by a concentration polarization inducing a counter osmotic pressure. It allows to treat the coupling between the convection (due to the permeation) and the  diffusion and to use the Péclet number.

The EM3E* file corresponds to courses in Separation Science for the Erasmus Munuds Programme in Membrane Engineering.

-EM3E_liquid_vapor_equilibrium for the plot of the dew point and bioling curve

-EM3E_Liquid_liquid_equilibrium for the plot of the binodal and tie lines in a ternary diagram
