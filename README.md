Python code for chemical engineering : master classes and research

This page contains some code that are used in chemical engineering classes at University of Toulouse (France). The M1* file correspond to exercises that are treated in the first year of the Master in chemical engineering of Toulouse (Universit√© Toulouse III).

-M1_electrochimie allow to calculate the oxydation rate of glucose at an electrode. It allow to treat the coupling between an heterogeneous reaction and the diffusion in a mass boundary layer and to use the Damkholer number.

-M1_cristal allow to calculate the growing rate of a cristal. It allow to treat the coupling between an heterogeneous reaction and the diffusion in a mass boundary layer and to use the Damkholer number for a second order reaction.

-M1_catalyseur allow to calculate the consomption of a reactant by a porous catalytic bead. It allow to treat the coupling between an heterogeneous reaction and the internal diffusion in the porous media and to use the Thiele modulus.
